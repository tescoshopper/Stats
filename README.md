# Stats
This is a Visual Studio 2019 Solution containing one C# console application project.
The purpose of the application is as a test harness for the referenced singleton Averages which contains functions to compute statistical (arithmetic mean) data from a matrix of real numbers.
Functions include mean average, standard deviation and class frequencies. Use of .NET Framework built-in math functions is avoided.
Unit tests are included to cover each function.
The application has a single parameter which requires a full path of a one-line CSV file containing numeric only >=0 values <100.
You will need to restore Nuget packages to build the application.
The simplest method of generating an executable for demonstration is to publish the application from Visual Studio.
